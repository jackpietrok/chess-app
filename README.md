Chess Engine by Jack Pietrok

-----------------------------
This is a for-fun chess game that I'm messing around with. Looking to play with enemy AI a bit and research some interesting algorithms/strategies for a "smart" chess engine. There are a lot of fully functional chess applications out there but I'm choosing to build mine from the ground up because... well, because i want to. 

As of now it has full functionality for running a complete chess game, including special moves like castling. However, the AI is set to pick completely random moves from those available (it will make sure it stays out of check, doesn't blantantly lose etc.), and my main goal now is to work on some different strategies for a more intelligent AI.

Also there are just so many bugs and bad formatting. Still working on that :)
